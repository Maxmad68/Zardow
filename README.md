# Quick overview
Zardow is a puzzle and platformer game, where the user have to place items in the level to help the pink alien (named Zardow) to reach his rocket, after having collected enough antimatter.<br>
In some levels, Zardow can cross teleportation portals, or reverse gravity.

# Pitch
Zardow is a small alien coming from another galaxy. His antimatter-powered spaceship failed around our solar system, and he had to land on our planet.<br>Help him to move through the different levels in order to collect enough antimatter, then to join back his rocket to take-off.<br><br>
The game has a lot of levels, in three different environments (including a "Tutorial" environment to discover the game mechanics).<br>
