# Pitch
Zardow is a small alien coming from another galaxy. His antimatter-powered spaceship failed around our solar system, and he had to land on our planet.<br>Help him to move through the different levels in order to collect enough antimatter, then to join back his rocket to take-off.<br><br>
The game has a lot of levels, in three different environments (including a "Tutorial" environment to discover the game mechanics).<br>
